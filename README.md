## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS Flex and Grid
- SASS (SCSS) file structure
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Throughout this challenge I learned event delegation, creation of dropdown menus and how to make a functioning lightbox. I also practiced my JavaScript coding in general.

### Continued development

I would like to focus on learning React to eliminate the tedious way of making an manipulating elements in vanilla JS and Bootstrap for a more efficient use of components as well as FetchAPI for working with API responses.
